## Project ICO Frontend Starter

Use this code as a starter for your project's frontend code.

Because frontend is not the focus of this course, feel free to collaborate with your cohort on frontend code as much as you like.

## Frontend Spec:
  - Displays how many tokens the user has purchased
  - Allows the user to deposit ETH into your ICO contract
  - Shows error messages when user makes an invalid request (i.e. attempting to deposit beyond the limit)

## Getting Started

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
